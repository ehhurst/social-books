## EXAMPLE USE CASE: CREATING AN ACCOUNT AND MAKING A NEW COMPETITION
- From the home page, the user can create a new account by selecting the Register button. Provide first name, last name, username and password and you will be registered and redirected to your user profile. 
- Users can navigate to the competitions from the home page. From there they can create a new competition.
- First, users can add books to their competition by the selecting “Add books” hyperlink. They are redirected to a book view page where they can add books to their competition from the Categories pages. Pressing “I’m finished adding books” takes them back to the creation menu.
- When the user elects to create a new competition, they must provide some information in a contest creation form. They must choose a contest title and end date. Failing to provide either yields this error message: “Make sure you have entered a title and end date for your competition and try again.”
- Next, users need to set a title and enddate for their competition. 
- When they have returned to the creation menu, users need to set a title and end date for their competition. 
- When satisfied with the competition books, title, and enddate, users can press submit to finalize their contest. Other users can join contests from the contests tab. 
- When other readers mark contest books as read, it advances their progress towards completion on the contest page and tracks their progress on the leaderboard, also visible from the contest page.
